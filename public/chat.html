            Wipping the text value once a message was successfully sent
            And we are also going to do something similar with the sendLocation
            It can take a sec or two for the geolocation call to actually complete.
            We're going to se the button disabled so someone doesn't span it.
            We're also going to update the text to say sending location so someone
            knows that something is happening in the background.
            Now both of this are going to change in index.js

                We are going to add another button. And when the user press
                that button we are going to use the geolocation API and usually 
                this is going to require the user to confirm they want to share 
                their location with this tab in the browser tat pop up box is 
                going to happen (there is no way arround that).
                And we're going to need to make sure that the user actually wants
                to share their location.
                Once we have the coordinates you're going to emit an event that's
                going to go to server. The server is going to send it to all the 
                users. And we are going to be able to render that information in
                a nice link.

        Mustache lets you inject values. which means we can setup places in our

    Add a from field to you index.html
    We are also going to add a listener in index.js that's going to wait for the form
    to be submitted.
    And inside of that listener listener we are going to fire socket.emit with the
    data typed in the fields.
    We are also going to render all incoming messages to the screen.
    
    To do the above we will use jQuery and be able to do that from our index.js file.
    http://jquery.com/download/
    and choose the compresed production version.
    save it and add it before our index so we can use it.
      <script src="/js/lib/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
    
    form is actualy going to go to a full page refresh then it's going to add to 
    the url ?message=test we will run some javascript to prevent this default action 
    with jquery. 
    see also index.js
    So we are going to attach a cutom event listener and override the 
    default behavior. To get that done we are going to use jquery to select this 
    form field before we dive 
    see also index.js

    We want to integrade moment on the client. And to do that we need to load 
    moment like we did with jQuery. But here we will grab the file from node_modules
    because it is their. And we grab the moment.js file and paste it inside the
    public/js/libs/moment.js and from here we are going to include it just like
    jQuery.<script src="/js/libs/moment.js"></script>
    Now we have acces to all of those moment functions inside of our client side.
    Which means over inside index we can properly format the timestamp that comes
    back inside of message.
    Now if we start the server.js and go to localhost:3000 inside the console
    we can use the moment
    moment().format()
    see index.js

When we are submit the from we get to the chat page but we dont do anything 
with the data passed from the form.
The goal is to take them pass them to the sever so the sever can keep track of 
who is in which room. And we can set that private configuration

The first step in getting this data to the server is figuring out where that data
live. This actualy lives in the location object. Location is a global object and
is provided by your browser.
In the browser in the console tab if we write 

>location
and run it. We have a lot of stuff like host,hostname,...etc. The one we are 
intrested of is search which is the query string. But to be sure its better to 
access it like that
>window.location.search

Adding window infront just to make sure we're accessing the global location 
property as opposed to a local variable which may or may not exist called location.

With jQuery we have access to a function jQuery.param() that we can pass in 
an object and it converts it into a query string so we can add it to a url.
>jQuery.param({name:'alex', age:25});<- - ->"name=alex&age=25"

Now the problem is that it can not do it the other direction. Meaning it cannot
take this strin 'name=alex&age=25' and convert it into an object.

In order to do that we are going to use a plugin called deparams if you search 
for:
links.mead.io/deparam
https://gist.github.com/andrewjmead/b71e03d8df237983285892f9a265d401
select raw and save it in public/js/libs/deparam.js
include it in chat.html we are not going to need it in index
<script src="/js/libs/deparam.js"></script>

Now that we include it. We can go and play whit this in the console tab.
In our browser in console tab we have access to jQuery.deparam
>jQuery.deparam

If we run the above statement we're going to get our function back confirming
that it does exist.
And all we need to do is pass in a string.(the searchstring)
Which in our case is in window.location.search

>jQuery.deparam(window.location.search);

So we are taking this object we are passing it to deparam and the result is an 
object exactly what we want. All the special characters are converted.
This is what we are going to use inside of our client side code to get the 
values and pass them to the server. This is all going to happend inside of 
chat.js
