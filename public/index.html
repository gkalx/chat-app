        Viewport tags let you specify certain things about how your site should
        be rendered.
        This view port tag is going to make our website display much better in
        mobile. Instead of being really zoomed out. Its going to fit to the 
        width of your phone tablet on any other device.
        <meta name="viewport" after that we can add a few options about what we
        want to do that viewport.
        All this is going to happened inside of content="
        And its going to be a comma separated list of key value pairs 
        one for example is width we're going to set it equal to device-width,
        And this tells your browser to use the devices width as the web pages 
        width.
        Then we can add a comma and specify our next key value pair.
        We will set initial-scale=1.0 
        This is going to scale the site appropriately so it doesn't look all
        zoomed out.
        And finaly add a comma and specify the final key value pair.
        user-scalable=no
        We have styles in place to make the text bigger and to make sure that 
        the user can always see everything. So there is no reason to give users
        the ability to scale.
